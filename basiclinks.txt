Raspberry Networking (headless)
Headless Raspbian WiFi Setup (https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/37920/how-do-i-set-up-networking-wifi-static-ip-address/37921#37921)
Raspbian, since May 2016, checks the contents of the boot directory for a file called wpa_supplicant.conf, and will copy the file into /etc/wpa_supplicant, replacing any existing wpa_supplicant.conf file that may be there. The file in the boot directory is then removed. This can be used to enable headless setup, using the wpa_supplicant.conf settings detailed below. (You will probably want to enable ssh as well.)
For headless setup, SSH can be enabled by placing a file named 'ssh', without any extension, onto the boot partition of the SD card.
